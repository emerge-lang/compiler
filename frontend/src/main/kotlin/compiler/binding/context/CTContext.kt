/**
 * Compile-Time context. A compile-time context knows all available symbols (through imports and explicit definition).
 * Contexts in which order of symbol declaration is irrelevant are mutable, contexts in which the order of declaration
 * *is* relevant are immutable. Contexts that mix these two parts are implemented by referring to a mutable context from
 * an immutable one (e.g. immutable context within function code refers to mutable context of the enclosing class/file).
 *
 * Consider this example (mutable, file level)
 *
 *     // mutable context A
 *     val x = 3 + y // x is added to A, A is mutated
 *     val y = 3     // y is added to A, A is mutated
 *
 * When x has to be evaluated, y is present because order of declaration is not important on file level.
 *
 * Another example (function scope, immutable):
 *
 *     fun fn(e: Int, f: Int) {
 *         // the immutable context A is initialized with e and f
 *         val g = e + f // a new context B is derived from A with g added to it
 *         val h = g + 1 // OK, h is evaluated in context B in which g is present
 *                       // context C is derived from B with h added to it
 *         val i = k + 1 // ERROR when evaluating i because k is not defined in context C
 *         val k = f + 1
 *     }
 *
 * The naming for (im)mutable context is coherent with Kotlin collections: CTContext is immutable, MutableCTContext
 * is mutable.
 * All contexts in use are [MutableCTContext]s; this interface contains only the immutable operations. It is used
 * to convey that the context must not be modified to assure correct compilation, CTFE or interpretation. Much like
 * the `immutable` keyword in Emerge.
