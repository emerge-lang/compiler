     *     val foo = myS.prop // here, unify is used to derive that `foo` is an `Int` now
     *
     * This is achieved by the mechanism of unification that is copied from prolog (or logic programming in general):
     *
     * let `this` be `S<T>`
     * let `assigneeType` be `S<Int>`
     *
     * Then the two `S` will match, and the type arguments will be aligned with each other, associating the
     * `T` type parameter with the `Int` type argument: the result is `mapOf(T to Int)`
     *
     * Note that the names on both sides are kept isolated from each other. E.g. we might have another class `F<T>`:
     *
     *     class F<T> {
     *       someS: S<T>
     *     }
     *
     * here, the `T` from the declaration in `F` is distinct from the `T in the declaration of `S`. Say we obtained
     * a value not known more concretely of the type `S<T>` as declared in `F`:
     *
     *      fun foo<T>(f: F<T>) -> T = f.someS
     *
     * Then, when analyzing this expression:
     *
     * `foo<Int>(myF).prop`, one has to unify `S<T>` with `S<T>` with the two Ts being distinct. To handle this correctly,
     * this method works with [IdentityHashMap] on the `T`s.
     *
     * If two disjoint ([isDisjointWith]) types are to be unified the final type will remain with the first-come-first-serve
     * type and a [ValueNotAssignableReporting] will be added to the [TypeUnification].
     *
     * The [Reporting]s added to [carry] will refer to `this` as the type being assigned to (member variable, function
     * parameter, ...) and [assigneeType] as the type of the value being assigned.
     *
     * References to generic types found in [assigneeType] will be put into [TypeUnification.bindings], and references to
     * generic types found in `this` will be put into [TypeUnification.right].
     *
     * @param assignmentLocation Used to properly locate errors, also for forwarding to [evaluateAssignabilityTo]
     * @param carry When multiple types have to be found at the same time (a function invocation with more than one parameter),
     *              one can carry the context/result between the unifications).
